# **Proactive detection of fraud in transactions**

In this notebook we develop a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company and use insights from the model to develop an actionable plan. Data for the case is available in CSV format having 6362620 rows and 10 columns.

1.  Data cleaning including missing values

2. Adressing Class imbalance

3. Adressing Multicollinearity to select variables to be included in the model

4. Training and Testing model performances

5. Outlier/Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest

6. Training a deep neural network on imbalanced dataset for fraud detection
